% \begin{myframedenv}
% In this paper, we pose the problem of maximizing the number of special messages allowed while observing the messaging constraints defined in IS-200 and IS-705 for the GPS signals L2C and L5.  The problem is posed using a graph of feasible message sequencing and then modelling the graphs as linear constraints for a linear programming (LP) problem.
