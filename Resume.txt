RESEARCH AND PAPERS
“Lie Groups, Homogeneous Manifolds, and Complex Projective Spaces”
by Atour Bean, Clinton Bowen, and Mayra Moran. Partially supported by
NSF grant DMS-0502258, May 2009.
	* 9 month research work and presentation performed in collaboration
	with two other individuals and one advisor. (Note: This project par-
	tially funded by NSF Grant DMS-0502258.) (May 2009)

Currently Researching the Risch Algorithm for Symbolic Integration.	
	* Current ongoing research work to develop and contribute code for
	Risch Algorithm to SAGE and/or MAXIMA open source computer
	algebra systems. Reading references include Symbolic Integration I-
	Transcendental Functions, by Manuel Bronstein.
